# Portfolio
My personal portfolio to showcase my skills as a web developer. I am using Gatsby to develop this site.

# Why?
I committed to following the curriculum found at The Odin Project through to the end. I've been exposed to a variety of technologies and techniques along the way. I am starting this project from scratch with minimal guidelines and hope the outcome is an adequate portrayal of my skills as developer.

# Concepts/technologies I practiced using:
- CSS-in-JS: Styled Components
- createGlobalStyle 
- responsive-react
- Gatsby
- Hooks: useState, useEffect
- Deployment with Netlify
